[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstatus_interpaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "status_interpaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "status_interpaces"
  with any of the following names:

    status_interpacesConfig.cmake
    status_interpaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "status_interpaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "status_interpaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "status_interpaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
